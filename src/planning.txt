[Done]
rename gains_bag to sim_bag and live_bag
add stake_cap in sparam
load_memories, update both sim_bag and live_bag, then we could have same start of both
we fixed load_memories first, and make sure sim/live bag work well, using print maybe
fix sim_retreat
fix retreat
also make sure sim and actual logic equal.
separate xBuy and sBuy to record difference bag.



[TODO]
figure out why black format not trigger automatically.


[WIP]
fix sim_attack
fix attack

plan:

2.

Question
1. should i migrate sim and actual together? since we already using Sim/Live bag...
    1.1 how attack feedback the actual executed price? could we simulate it?
    1.2 should i move the order filled logic out of attack?
    1.3 should we increase order filled logic check frequency? or using call back?


sim logic:
1. find buy_signal
    buy_signal = kelly > 0 and gains_bag.is_enough_cash
    budget = gains_bag.discharge(kelly)
    price = fetch from huobi
    position = budget/price
    Note: using close price to calculate position.... hmmmm

attach logic:
1. s_buy_order = xBuyOrder.notna & xBuyOrder != Cancel & xBuy.isna()
2. fetch buy_order content by id, if found filled into excel
3. buy_signal = gains_bag.is_enough_cash
4. budget = gains_bag.discharge(1)
5. cancell all previous orders and update xBuyOrder = Cancel
6. position = budget/price
7.
